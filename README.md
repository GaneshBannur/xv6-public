# Extending xv6

The following extensions were made to xv6

1. Defined a new exception and added a trap handler to handle the exception
   
   The interrupt number 78 is unused in the x86 architecture so it can be used to define a new exception.
   The new exception is defined to occur when an invalid memory access occurs within a program.
   For example it occurs when a program tries to access an element which is out of bounds of a data structure.
   In the test program testprg.c the interrupt occurs when an out-of-bounds index is tried to be accessed in an array.
   
2. Added a system call to trace the system calls made by a process

   The system call named "trace" is created which traces the system calls made by a process if tracing is enabled gloablly and for that process.
   The test program trd.c forks a child and waits for it to complete. The child opens and closes a file to demonstrate the open and close system calls.
   The test program shows three modes in which a process can execute:
   1. Only the process being traced
   2. The process and its children being traced
   3. Process not being traced

### Original README:

NOTE: we have stopped maintaining the x86 version of xv6, and switched
our efforts to the RISC-V version
(https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv.git)

xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern x86-based multiprocessor using ANSI C.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

xv6 is inspired by John Lions's Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition (Peer
to Peer Communications; ISBN: 1-57398-013-7; 1st edition (June 14,
2000)). See also https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/, which
provides pointers to on-line resources for v6.

xv6 borrows code from the following sources:
    JOS (asm.h, elf.h, mmu.h, bootasm.S, ide.c, console.c, and others)
    Plan 9 (entryother.S, mp.h, mp.c, lapic.c)
    FreeBSD (ioapic.c)
    NetBSD (console.c)

ERROR REPORTS

We don't process error reports (see note on top of this file).

BUILDING AND RUNNING XV6

To build xv6 on an x86 ELF machine (like Linux or FreeBSD), run
"make". On non-x86 or non-ELF machines (like OS X, even on x86), you
will need to install a cross-compiler gcc suite capable of producing
x86 ELF binaries (see https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/).
Then run "make TOOLPREFIX=i386-jos-elf-". Now install the QEMU PC
simulator and run "make qemu".
